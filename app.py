Act as a clinical researcher specialized in evidence-based medicine. I need you to conduct a structured literature review on the following topic:

**Research Topic:** {research_topic}

Use the PICO framework:
- **Population (P):** {population}
- **Intervention (I):** {intervention}
- **Comparison (C):** {comparison}
- **Outcome (O):** {outcome}

**Instructions:**
1. Retrieve evidence from the following study types: {', '.join(study_types)}.
2. Only include studies published within the last {publication_year_limit} years.
3. Prefer references from: {', '.join(preferred_sources)}.
4. Provide references with PubMed links or DOI.
5. Present the findings in {output_format}.
6. Summarize key conclusions and highlight gaps in current research.

Optional: If applicable, suggest potential future research directions.
